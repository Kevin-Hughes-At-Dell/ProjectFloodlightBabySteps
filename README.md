# ProjectFloodlightBabySteps
This is my first foray into this as an embedded developer helping to create a hardware based OpenFlow switch.

I am familiar with Git and am trying to use PFL as the controller to test our OF-DPA based OpenFlow switch.  We are using Indigo as the northbound controller interface, and things are coming up when I pull the V0.9 build, however I need to support V1.3 of OpenFlow and am having trouble building the V1.0 source with that support.  It wants Java 1.7, which I have installed, but ant doesn't like it when I run the command.  This PF Baby Steps repository is my first foray into seeking open source community help.  I am guessing I need to open up an issue as well as trogging about this in my README...(:-)
